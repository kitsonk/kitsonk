I am a Principal Technologist at [CTO Labs](https://www.ctolabs.com.au/) where I don't get the opportunity to write much code for work anymore. That doesn't stop me pursuing it as a hobby though.

Formally I was a core contributor to [Deno](https://deno.com/) where I laid a lot of the foundations for the integration of TypeScript, integrated the langauge server and laid the groundwork for auto-generating documentation. I also created a few side projects to help enrich the eco-system.

I also previously worked at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com), [SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com/), [NOW](https://www.nowtv.com/), [Sky](https://sky.com/), [Dimension Data](https://services.global.ntt/) (now NTT Services), and [eLoyalty](https://www.ttec.com/) (now part of TTEC), where I was involved in various leadership and consulting roles. At SitePen I was the CTO and the Project Lead for [Dojo 2.0](https://dojo.io/).

My projects:

|Project| |
|-|-|
|oak|A koa/express like middleware framework, originally created Deno but runs on Node.js, Cloudflare Workers and Bun as well.|
|acorn|A focused server side router for creating JSON RESTful API servers. All the learnings from oak in a more focused solution.|

Major contributions:
