I am a Principal Technologist at [CTO Labs](https://www.ctolabs.com.au/) where I
don't get the opportunity to write much code for work anymore. That doesn't stop
me pursuing it as a hobby though.

Formally I was a core contributor to [Deno](https://deno.com/) where I laid a
lot of the foundations for the integration of TypeScript, integrated the
language server and laid the groundwork for auto-generating documentation. I
also created a few side projects to help enrich the eco-system.

I also previously worked at [Thoughtworks](https://thoughtworks.com),
[SitePen](https://www.sitepen.com/), [NOW](https://www.nowtv.com/),
[Sky](https://sky.com/), [Dimension Data](https://services.global.ntt/) (now NTT
Services), and [eLoyalty](https://www.ttec.com/) (now part of TTEC), where I was
involved in various leadership and consulting roles. At SitePen I was the CTO
and the Project Lead for [Dojo 2.0](https://dojo.io/).

I am lucky enough to be able to pursue my side projects while working full-time
doing technical due diligence and advisory consulting. Some folks though are
pursuing their passion. If you find any of my stuff useful, or you are getting
use out of open source software, consider
[sponsoring a developer or project](https://github.com/sponsors/) on GitHub.

These are open source projects that I created and actively maintain:
